	<h3>Cheyenne Depot Plaza &amp; Depot Museum</h3>
	<p>Home to the majority of Cheyenne&rsquo;s outdoor events, including many events during Frontier Days, the Depot Plaza is a great destination. There are also 6 boots located around the plaza, including one hidden behind the Depot Museum. 
	<br><br>After strolling through the Plaza, check out the Depot Museum, a National Historic Landmark. Formerly a Union Pacific Depot, it has been restored to house a visitor center, restaurant, and museum. It is the perfect stop for those interested in the railroad.

  <h3>Cheyenne Boots</h3>
  <p>Many like to take on the challenge of journeying around Cheyenne to get photos of all the Cheyenne boots. The original 18 are featured in an audio tour by calling <a href="tel:3073160067">307-316-0067</a>. <a href="cheyenne_boots.pdf" target="_blank">This document</a> is also a great resource complete with a map and addresses.</p>
